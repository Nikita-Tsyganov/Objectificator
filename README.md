## Description

A project on an accessibility theme made during the [GDG DevFest Winnipeg](https://devfest2019.firebaseapp.com/) Hackthon

The idea of the project is to be able to help people with visual impairment by taking a picture of the area where a certain object supposed to be located (a door for example). Then receive a voice command what object to look for, processes the image and notifies the user regarding the object direction on the picture or its absence.

## How to run

Just click [here](https://nikita-tsyganov.github.io/Objectificator)

OR

Download the repository to your machine.
Navigate to "Objectificator-master" folder.
Start the app by launching the index.html file in your browser.

## How to use

Allow the app to use your camera and mic. Take a picture, then, talk to app and tell what is the object you are looking for. The app will process your request and will tell you a location of the object.

## Notes

The image processing does not work, because it requires the server with the image recognition.
